# Getting Started with Web Development in 2025

Web development has evolved tremendously over the years, and 2024 is an exciting time to start your journey. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to update your skills, this guide will help you navigate the modern web development landscape.

## The Foundation: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Before diving into frameworks and libraries, it's crucial to build a solid foundation:

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the backbone of every web page. It provides the structure and semantic meaning to your content.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Web Development!</h1>
    <p>This is your first step into an amazing journey.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS brings your HTML to life with styling, layouts, and animations.

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### JavaScript

JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to your websites.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  const heading = document.querySelector("h1");
  heading.addEventListener("click", function () {
    alert("Welcome to JavaScript!");
  });
});
```

## Modern Development Tools

### Version Control with Git

Git is essential for tracking changes and collaborating with others:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Package Managers

- **npm**: The default package manager for Node.js
- **yarn**: A fast, reliable alternative to npm
- **pnpm**: Efficient and space-saving package manager

### Code Editors

- **Visual Studio Code**: Free, powerful, and extensible
- **WebStorm**: Feature-rich IDE for professional development
- **Sublime Text**: Lightweight and fast

## Popular Frameworks and Libraries

### Frontend

- **React**: Component-based library for building user interfaces
- **Vue.js**: Progressive framework for building UIs
- **Angular**: Full-featured framework for large applications

### Backend

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Express.js**: Minimal web framework for Node.js
- **Next.js**: React framework with server-side rendering

## Learning Path

1. **Start with the basics**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. **Learn a version control system**: Git and GitHub
3. **Choose a frontend framework**: React is a great starting point
4. **Understand build tools**: Webpack, Vite, or Parcel
5. **Learn backend development**: Node.js and Express.js
6. **Database fundamentals**: SQL and NoSQL databases
7. **Deployment and hosting**: Vercel, Netlify, or AWS
